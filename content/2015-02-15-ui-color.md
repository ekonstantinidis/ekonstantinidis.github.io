Summary: Have you ever developed an iOS mobile application in Objective C or in Swift? Then I guess at some point you have "googled" convert HEX or RGB colours to UIColor or UIColor picker. Same happened with me. So while I was developing "Go Back" - an application written in Swift where you can store your location and find your way back there at any time - I had to use a color converter or a color picker for UI Color.

UIcolor.io is a tiny Angular app, where you can either convert HEX & RGB(A) colours or you can use the color picker and it will generate the code you need to copy & paste to your iOS application.


    # It's obvious that it's not that easy to convert colors without a converter
    HEX: #bd3e3e
    RGB: R-189 G-62 B-62

    Objective C: [UIColor colorWithRed:0.74 green:0.24 blue:0.24 alpha:1.0];
    Swift: UIColor(red:0.74, green:0.24, blue:0.24, alpha:1.0)


I guess after the example above it will all make sense right? So this application is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and the code is open to anyone if you can to evolve in this one! If not just use it! It's free and easy to use. You can now head to [http://www.uicolor.io/](http://www.uicolor.io/) and give it a try.
